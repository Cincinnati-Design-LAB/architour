          The marble staircase leading to the vault was uncovered and restored,
          preparing for an upcoming project that will incorporate a speakeasy
          below. The marble floors were polished and repaired, while the
          elevator cabs were adorned with bronze wraps. Custom features included
          gold-leaf accents, an acoustical wood slat wall, and a mirrored band
          just below the ceiling that visually enhances the space, honoring the
          original expansive atmosphere of the banking floor. To refresh the
          exterior, the unremarkable aluminum entrances were replaced with new
          brass ones, and a blue canopy along with updated building signage were
          installed.

The Atlas Building, originally known as The National Atlas Bank, was constructed in 1924. However, it underwent renovations in 1980 that further damaged and concealed the building's original beauty and historical significance. In 2021, Urban Sites completed a comprehensive renovation of the Atlas Building, transforming it into an office space designed specifically for creative professionals.

Although this historic building has experienced multiple renovations over the years, Urban Sites ensured that the latest updates respectfully honored the original layout and design elements of the bank's architecture. This thoughtful approach preserves the building's rich history while adapting it for modern use, resulting in a unique blend of heritage, Art Deco influences, and contemporary functionality.
