The Atlas Building, originally known as The National Atlas Bank, was constructed in 1924. However, it underwent renovations in 1980 that further damaged and concealed the building's original beauty and historical significance. In 2021, Urban Sites completed a comprehensive renovation of the Atlas Building, transforming it into an office space designed specifically for creative professionals.

Although this historic building has experienced multiple renovations over the years, Urban Sites ensured that the latest updates respectfully honored the original layout and design elements of the bank's architecture. This thoughtful approach preserves the building's rich history while adapting it for modern use, resulting in a unique blend of heritage, Art Deco influences, and contemporary functionality.
