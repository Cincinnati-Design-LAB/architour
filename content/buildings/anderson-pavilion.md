          Carol Ann's Carousel is located above the events center.  The carousel
          was funded with a grant from the Haile Foundation to the Cincinnati
          Parks Board in honor of Carol Ann Haile.  The carousel and its custom
          carved and painted animals were created by Carousel Works in
          Mansfield, Ohio.  The animals represent aspects of Cincinnati history
          and daily life and reference the Bengals, the Bearcats, P&G,
          Ocktoberfest, and many other Cincinnati icons.

The pavilion was funded by a donation from the Anderson Foundation to honor Annie W. & Elizabeth M. Anderson, sisters who were noted local philanthopists and decendents of Nicholas Longworth, one of Cincinnati's early settlers who was also a noted philanthropist and stateman and who built the residence that is now the Taft Museum of Art.
