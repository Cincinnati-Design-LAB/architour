  Carol Ann's Carousel is located above the events center.  The carousel was

  animals were created by Carousel Works in Mansfield, Ohio.  The animals
  represent aspects of Cincinnati history and daily life and reference the
  Bengals, the Bearcats, P&G, Ocktoberfest, and many other Cincinnati icons.

The pavilion was funded by a donation from the Anderson Foundation to honor Annie W. & Elizabeth M. Anderson, sisters who were noted local philanthopists and decendents of Nicholas Longworth, one of Cincinnati's early settlers who was also a noted philanthropist and stateman and who built the residence that is now the Taft Museum of Art.
