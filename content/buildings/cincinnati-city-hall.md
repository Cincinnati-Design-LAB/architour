  Referencing the work of H. H. Richardson, the muscular style of the building
  creates an impression of strength, stability, and power.  The tower, turrets,
  massive arches, and scale of the materials suggest a fortress-like quality.  A
  large courtyard is located in the center of the building and has been studied
  for enclosure.

In 1884, Cincinnati experienced a courthouse riot followed by a labor riot two years later. Downtown residents were concerned about trends toward violence, and a new mayor was elected to gain control. The design of the new City Hall was intended to stand as a symbol of the government's power.
