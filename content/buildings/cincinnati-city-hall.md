          Referencing the work of H. H. Richardson, the muscular style of the
          building creates an impression of strength, stability, and power.  The
          tower, turrets, massive arches, and scale of the materials suggest a
          fortress-like quality.  A large courtyard is located in the center of
          the building and has been studied for enclosure.

In 1884, Cincinnati experienced a courthouse riot followed by a labor riot two years later. Downtown residents were concerned about trends toward violence, and a new mayor was elected to gain control. The design of the new City Hall was intended to stand as a symbol of the government's power.
