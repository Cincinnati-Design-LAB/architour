          The building follows the classic tripartite form of base, shaft and
          cap.  The greek temple form that tops the building was based on the
          Mausoleum of Halicarnassus.  Since the style of the building is not
          consistent with Cass Gilbert's work at that time, it was rumored that
          the project was design by Garber & Woodward with Gilbert lending his
          name to the project.

When constructed, it was the tallest building in the US outside of NYC and the fifth largest building in the world. The building is a representation of a classic tripartite form of base, shaft and cap with a Grecian temple as the cap.
