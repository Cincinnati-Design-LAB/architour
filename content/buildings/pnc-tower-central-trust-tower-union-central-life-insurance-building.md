  The building follows the classic tripartite form of base, shaft and cap.  The
  greek temple form that tops the building was based on the Mausoleum of
  Halicarnassus.  Since the style of the building is not consistent with Cass
  Gilbert's work at that time, it was rumored that the project was design by
  Garber & Woodward with Gilbert lending his name to the project.

When constructed, it was the tallest building in the US outside of NYC and the fifth largest building in the world. The building is a representation of a classic tripartite form of base, shaft and cap with a Grecian temple as the cap.
