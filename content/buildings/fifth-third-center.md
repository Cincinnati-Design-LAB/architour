  The tower was one of the first buildings designed to integrate with the City's
  new skywalk system.  The skywalk traversed the north side of Fountain Square
  Plaza and crossed through the tower connecting across Walnut to the 580
  Building.  Remnants of the skywalk system still exist crossing Walnut.  It was
  also home to the Bankers Club located on the 30th floor of the building.

The tower was the first major building constructed as part of the implementation of the 1964 Downtown Plan.
