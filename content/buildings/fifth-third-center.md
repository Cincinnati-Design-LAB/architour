          The tower was one of the first buildings designed to integrate with
          the City's new skywalk system.  The skywalk traversed the north side
          of Fountain Square Plaza and crossed through the tower connecting
          across Walnut to the 580 Building.  Remnants of the skywalk system
          still exist crossing Walnut.  It was also home to the Bankers Club
          located on the 30th floor of the building.
