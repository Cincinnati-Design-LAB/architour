          The latest renovation and addition wrapped the existing building with
          a circular modern zinc faÃ§ade and expansive glazing making the
          building more outwardly focused.  The interior was completely
          renovated adding a 90-foot tall atrium and creating student support
          spaces that offer modern conveniences similar to a shopping mall.
