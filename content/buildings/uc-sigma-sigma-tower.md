          "The tower has a number of symbolic aspects in its design. Its square
          base forms the letters U and C on alternating sides. Above these
          letters, the main wooden shafts rise in the form of hammers. These
          motifs reflect the fraternity's motto, "The torch burns; the hammers
          ring." At the top, a beam of light shines through a stylized stainless
          steel torch and changes colors through the use of a computer
          program."  Source: www.azahner.com/works/sigma-tower

The Sigma Sigma Commons and the Ronald F. Walker Tower were funded by the honorary fraternity Sigma Sigma. It raised $1.8 million to fund the project in a campaign that lasted only 3 months! The 3.5 acre site is a magnet for student activity and includes an amphitheater that seats 1,850 people for special performances.
