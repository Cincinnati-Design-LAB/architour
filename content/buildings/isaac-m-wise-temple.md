  "CIncinnati architect James Keyes Wilson's (1828-1894) blending of Byzantine,
  Gothic, and Islamic elements was the first American attempt to create a
  'Jewish architecture' - a mix of styles symbolizing the intellectural and
  cultural currents that had influenced Jewish culture."  From "The Bicentennial
  Guide to Greater Cincinnati: A Portrait of Two Hundred Years" by The
  Cincinnati Historical Society.

The congregation was led by Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, the founder of Reform Judaism in North America. The Spanish influences on the design recall the Golden Age in Spain before the Inquisition, a time when Jewish culture flourished.
