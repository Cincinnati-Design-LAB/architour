          The school was relocated from the Cincinnati Art Museum, and the
          architects created references to the former location.  For example,
          treads from a stair were relocated and placed in the floor of the
          lobby so that everyone who enters the building crosses the old stair
          treads.  Other treads were used to create benches throughout the
          facility.  The central lightwell includes a staircase that is rotated
          7 degrees to align with the former building at the Art Museum.  This
          lightwell brings daylight deep into the building.  The perimeter of
          the building is composed of industrial sash windows that also provide
          high quality daylight into the studios.

          The building received a LEED Silver Certification due in large part to
          its extensive use of natural light and reuse and repurposing of
          materials and lighting.
