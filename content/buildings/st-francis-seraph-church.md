          The sanctuary is a "hall" type church with no height variation between
          the central and side aisles.  Consequently, the church has very high
          windows and is flooded with daylight.  McLaughlin mixed styles in the
          design of the church using Itanianate towers juxtaposed against a
          French rose window.  The sanctuary houses unique art that traces its
          history.  A painting in a nave is a replica of one in Tyrol, Austria
          where the Franciscans who founded the church originally lived.  A
          painting of St. Francis of Assisi, the namesake of the church, was
          restored and shows St Francis' vision of a Seraphic angel. Paintings
          by Johann Schmitt, a Kentucky artist whose religious themed paintings
          were popular in this area, also adorn the walls.  The Stations of the
          Cross originally hung in St Paul's Church and were relocated to St
          Francis Seraph when that church wa decommissioned.

        description: >-
          Over its many decades, this parish church has sought to meet not only
          the spiritual needs of its people but also the social and physical
          ones as well. In 1859, the Franciscans established St. Francis Seraph
          School.  A soup kitchen opened in the 1980s to meet the needs of
          parishioners and neighbors. The parish was also responsible for the
          following:  Sarah Center, a women's enrichment program, a parish nurse
          program, a lunch bag program for day laborers, a financial assistance
          program, and a hospitality center for homeless people.

The first Catholic church in the Greater Cincinnati area, Christ Church, was built on the site of St. Francis Seraph in 1819. Because of the anti-Catholic sentiment that existed in the city and troughout the country, the church was located north of Central Parkway where land was cheap and where there were no city taxes. When Edward Fenwick became bishop, he directed the relocation of the original church in 1822 to the current site of St. Xavier Church at Sixth and Sycamore, and St. Francis Seraph Church was constructed at the original location. Since Christ Church included a cemetery, many of those interred were relocated to other cemeteries, but some families saw it as an honor to have the graves of their ancestors placed under the new church. The crypt is located under the alter of the new church.
