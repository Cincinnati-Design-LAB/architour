The building offers loft-style living in the Over the Rhine area that is very different from other residential offerings. The 44 units have ceiling heights ranging from 13-15 feet with large industrial sash style windows. The building will have over 10,000 s.f. of commercial space, and it is only a half-block walk away from Findlay Market.
