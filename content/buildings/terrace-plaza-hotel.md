unique_features: >-
  The building was one of SOM's first major commissions.  Along with the
  inventive approach to planning, unique features were incorporated in the
  design such as the adjoining room strategy.  Selected wall separating rooms
  were designed to slide upward into a cavity to allow two rooms to become one
  without obstructions.  Art was also an important part of the hotel's design
  and character.  An Alexander Calder mobile was a prominent part of the lobby.
  A mural by Saul Steinberg  covered a wall in the Skyline Restaurant on the
  Eighth Floor, and the curved wall of the Gourmet Room held a mural by Joan
  Miro.

One of the first mixed use projects in the US, the 7-story base housed 2 department stores, and the hotel lobby was located on the 8th floor with 10 floors of hotel rooms above. The Eighth Floor lobby opened onto a landscaped terrace on the east end overlooking Fountain Square. A circular restaurant located on the top floor housed the Gourmet Room, one of the city's 5-star restaurants.
