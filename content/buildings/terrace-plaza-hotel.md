          The building was one of SOM's first major commissions.  Along with the
          inventive approach to planning, unique features were incorporated in
          the design such as the adjoining room strategy.  Selected wall
          separating rooms were designed to slide upward into a cavity to allow
          two rooms to become one without obstructions.  Art was also an
          important part of the hotel's design and character.  An Alexander
          Calder mobile was a prominent part of the lobby. A mural by Saul
          Steinberg  covered a wall in the Skyline Restaurant on the Eighth
          Floor, and the curved wall of the Gourmet Room held a mural by Joan
          Miro.

One of the first mixed use projects in the US, the 7-story base housed 2 department stores, and the hotel lobby was located on the 8th floor with 10 floors of hotel rooms above. The Eighth Floor lobby opened onto a landscaped terrace on the east end overlooking Fountain Square. A circular restaurant located on the top floor housed the Gourmet Room, one of the city's 5-star restaurants.
