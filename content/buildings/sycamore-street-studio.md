          The studio and residence is a complex of three buildings configured
          around a central courtyard similar to the garden homes in New
          Orleans.  The owner is a collector of sculpture, and the residence is
          filled with significant works by early Cincinnati artists. The
          free-hand painted ceilings on the first floor and stenciled ceilings
          on the second are original.  The owner has made selected changes to
          the residence decorative plaster and carvings that he has created.
