The building is the home of the Mercantile Library, a private library established in 1845 for the use of its members who were pursuing mercantile careers. The library was located in the Cincinnati College building. The original building burned, but the books were saved. When the building was being reconstructed, Judge Alfonso Taft, the father of the President and attorney for the college, negotiated a lease for the library that allowed it to remain for 10,000 years free of rent. The 1845 building was demolished and reconstructed to create a larger building, and the library's lease was maintained. It was relocated to the upper floors of the building where it continues to operate today as a private library.
