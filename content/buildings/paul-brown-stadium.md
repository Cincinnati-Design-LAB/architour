The stadium was the first NFL facility to win a national AIA Honor Award for its design, and it received an Architectural Record/Busines Week Award in 2001. It is also the only football stadium to be listed among "American's favorite 150 buildings and structures" in a 2007 survey conducted by Harris Interactive and commissioned by the American Institute of Architects (AIA).
