          The complex of builldings had been tied toegther with infill
          construction to create more desireable floorplates for today's market
          demands.  Located on the northeast corner of Washington Park, M+A has
          realized increased collaboration with other organizations in the
          community by being located in a walkable neighborhood on the streetcar
          route with access to other design firms in the area.  The firm also
          enjoys access to Washington Park and the nearly nightly events that
          occur there during the summer.

          The existing building has been repurposed, and much of the original
          shell has been preserved.  Operable windows provide excellent
          daylighting and natural ventilation to the space, and energy
          consumption has been reduced through the incorporation of LED lighting
          throughout the space.
