  create more desireable floorplates for today's market demands.  Located on the
  northeast corner of Washington Park, M+A has realized increased collaboration
  with other organizations in the community by being located in a walkable
  neighborhood on the streetcar route with access to other design firms in the
  area.  The firm also enjoys access to Washington Park and the nearly nightly
  events that occur there during the summer.
