The first floor hall served as a home for the many German-American societies that existed in Cincinnati at the time. It became a target of anti-German sentiment as the US entered WW2. The company name was changed to the Hamilton County Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Cincinnati, and the sculpture of Germania was renamed Columbia.
