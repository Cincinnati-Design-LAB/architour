          The whimsical environmental sculpture was designed by the
          Minneapolis-based team of artist Andrew Leicester in conjuction with
          architect Garth Rockcastle.  As visitors enter the park, they pass
          through a symbolic canal boat lock under a bridge anchored by columns
          desiged to look like smoke stacks from the steam boats that frequented
          the city.  These columns are topped with sculptures of winged "flying
          pigs", a reference to Cincinnati's days as a meat-packing center when
          it received the nickname, "Porkopolis".  The focal point is the flood
          column that depicts the history of three significant floods and is
          topped by a ark as a symbol of the surviving the floods.  Atop the
          undulating wall is a scaled replica of the Ohio River as it stretches
          from Pittsburgh to Cairo with Cincinnati at the center.  The fountain
          stream depicts the dams, locks and bridges that cross the river.  The
          crowns suspended from the "tall stack" columns represents Cincinnati's
          place as the Queen City of the West.
