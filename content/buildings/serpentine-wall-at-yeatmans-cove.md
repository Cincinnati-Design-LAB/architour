          The massive scale of the wall mitigates between the river and the park
          behind it.  The undulating form supports public gatherings along the
          river, and it opens into a larger amphitheatre at the east end of the
          wall.  The largest of the public gatherings is the Labor Day
          celebration sponsored by Western & Southern, Riverfest, that draws
          over 500,000 people and features a fireworks display choreographed to
          music developed by local radio station, WEBN.

The wall was part of the city's initial efforts to reclaim the riverfont for public use. Much of the riverfront was previously occupied by businesses that relied upon river tansportation to move their resources and goods. The serpentine wall was the first development to allow the public to come to the river's edge. The undulating form was purportedly a reference to the famous indian burial mound in nearby Adams County, Serpent Mound.
