  The massive scale of the wall mitigates between the river and the park behind
  it.  The undulating form supports public gatherings along the river, and it
  opens into a larger amphitheatre at the east end of the wall.  The largest of
  the public gatherings is the Labor Day  celebration sponsored by Western &
  Southern, Riverfest, that draws over 500,000 people and features a fireworks
  display choreographed to music developed by local radio station, WEBN.

The wall was part of the city's initial efforts to reclaim the riverfont for public use. Much of the riverfront was previously occupied by businesses that relied upon river tansportation to move their resources and goods. The serpentine wall was the first development to allow the public to come to the river's edge. The undulating form was purportedly a reference to the famous indian burial mound in nearby Adams County, Serpent Mound.
