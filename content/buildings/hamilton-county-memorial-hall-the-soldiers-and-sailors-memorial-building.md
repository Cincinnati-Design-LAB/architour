          The hall features marble staircases adorned with intricate wrought
          iron that lead to the 556-seat proscenium theater, dubbed the Annie W.
          and Elizabeth M. Anderson Theater. Exceptional acoustics, decorative
          murals and Tiffany chandeliers enhance this historic performance
          space, completed with stenciled murals by Francis Pedretti. Memorial
          Hall offers an elegant setting for performances and unique spaces for
          social and business events.

          The goal of the renovation was to preserve but freshen the appearance
          of the acoustically perfect theatre while adding modern amenities such
          as air conditioning, updated restrooms, and a catering kitchen.  The
          new facility is operated by 3CDC and offers approximately 300 events
          per year including concerts, lectures, films, family programming,
          comedy, and themed parties. The facility is available for rental for
          corporate events, social gatherings, weddings, and theatrical events.
