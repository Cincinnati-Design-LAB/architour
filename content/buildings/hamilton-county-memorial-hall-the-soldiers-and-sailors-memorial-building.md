  The goal of the renovation was to preserve but freshen the appearance of the
  acoustically perfect theatre while adding modern amenities such as air
  conditioning, updated restrooms, and a catering kitchen.  The new facility is
  operated by 3CDC and offers approximately 300 events per year including
  concerts, lectures, films, family programming, comedy, and themed parties. The
  facility is available for rental for corporate events, social gatherings,
  weddings, and theatrical events.
