          This is a 16-story limestone American Building has two distinctive
          architectural features, firstly looking at the exterior of the
          building design that features a series of setbacks or recesses,
          creating a tiered or layered appearance rather than a flat surface.
          This makes the building very visually interesting and adds to
          complexity of the structure. Secondly the use of geometric details
          that the building has throughout it, additionally the lobby ceiling
          consist of Rookwood tiles that residents refer to it as the " Game Of
          Thrones Room".
