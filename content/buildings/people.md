The building renovation was done with a local focus employing designers (City Studios), contractors (Graybach), fabricators (Riverside), and vendors (Brush Factory & Switch) from the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. The renovations minimally impacted the existing shell of the building while creating contrasting modern elements inside the shell.
