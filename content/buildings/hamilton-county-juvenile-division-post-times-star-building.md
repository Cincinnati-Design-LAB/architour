          "The scuptural program by Ernest B. Haswell and Jules Brys is rich in
          literary, historical, and mythological references to journalism and
          learning. It offers the view a measure of mystery and visual delight
          found in a medieval church.  The canted corners of the tower project
          three-dimensional figures in a manner that recalls Bertram Goodhue's
          popular Nebraska State Capitol (ca. 1922).  Large bas-reliefs below
          the statuary contain profile portraits of printing icons, including
          Franklin and Gutenberg.  Carved panels of shields guraded by winged
          lions adorn the lower levels."  from Architecture in Cincinnati, Sue
          Ann Painter, Ohio University Press in association with the
          Architectural Foundation of Cincinnati.
