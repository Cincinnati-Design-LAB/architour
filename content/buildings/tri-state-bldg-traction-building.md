          The building follows the classic tripartite form typical of the
          Chicago style with minimal detail.  The smooth granite base constrasts
          with the rusticated brick detail of the building shaft accentuating
          each floor line contrasted with the terra cotta capital in white.  The
          contrast created a clarity of intention that is unique in Burnham's
          work in Cincinnati.
