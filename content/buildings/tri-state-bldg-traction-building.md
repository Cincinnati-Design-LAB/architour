unique_features: >-
  The building follows the classic tripartite form typical of the Chicago style
  with minimal detail.  The smooth granite base constrasts with the rusticated
  brick detail of the building shaft accentuating each floor line contrasted
  with the terra cotta capital in white.  The contrast created a clarity of
  intention that is unique in Burnham's work in Cincinnati.
