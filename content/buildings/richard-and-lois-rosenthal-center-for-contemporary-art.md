          The "urban carpet" concept connects the building to the street by
          extending the sidewalk into the building.  The radiused transition
          between the "urban carpet" and the rear wall of the building carries
          the plane up the height of the building thru a lightwell that houses a
          dramatic, cascading stair connecting the upper galleries.
