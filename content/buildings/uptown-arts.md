          The current entry is on the back side of the original building, and
          other structures that faced Liberty were demolished over time which
          explains the lack of windows in this facade.  Since the building was
          used originally by light industry, the renovation honored that
          tradition by preserving as much of the original building as possible
          and exposing the bones of the building. Materials such as corregated
          steel and industrial sash windows were used to relate to the history
          of the building.  Anything that was replaced in the original building
          was replicated.  Old elevator doors were maintained to create the feel
          of the manufacturing environment.

          Uptown Arts' mission is "To find and develop the natural artistic
          talent in every child in ways that realize their full potential, are
          fun and enriching, build self confidence, encourage free expression,
          expand the lives of children and their caregivers, and provide a safe
          and friendly environment."  Classes for 5 to 11 year olds are offered
          on weekdays after school and on Saturday mornings. Classes include
          music, art, acting, dance and African Dance and Drums. All classes are
          free to eligible children.  Uptown Arts collaborates with all of the
          major arts institutions throughout the Cincinnati area to provide a
          high-quality educational experience for children who are not typically
          exposed to the arts as a potential in their lives.  The design of the
          building makes students and their families feel like they are in a
          special place.  It is fastidiously maintained to reinforce that
          sense.  Participants in the programs are called "artists", "dancers",
          "musicians", etc. to make these students see themselves as creative
          people.
