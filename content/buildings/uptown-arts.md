  The current entry is on the back side of the original building, and other
  structures that faced Liberty were demolished over time which explains the
  lack of windows in this facade.  Since the building was used originally by
  light industry, the renovation honored that tradition by preserving as much of
  the original building as possible and exposing the bones of the building.
  Materials such as corregated steel and industrial sash windows were used to
  relate to the history of the building.  Anything that was replaced in the
  original building was replicated.  Old elevator doors were maintained to
  create the feel of the manufacturing environment.

  Uptown Arts' mission is "To find and develop the natural artistic talent in
  every child in ways that realize their full potential, are fun and enriching,
  build self confidence, encourage free expression, expand the lives of children
  and their caregivers, and provide a safe and friendly environment."  Classes
  for 5 to 11 year olds are offered on weekdays after school and on Saturday
  mornings. Classes include music, art, acting, dance and African Dance and
  Drums. All classes are free to eligible children.  Uptown Arts collaborates
  with all of the major arts institutions throughout the Cincinnati area to
  provide a high-quality educational experience for children who are not
  typically exposed to the arts as a potential in their lives.  The design of
  the building makes students and their families feel like they are in a special
  place.  It is fastidiously maintained to reinforce that sense.  Participants
  in the programs are called "artists", "dancers", "musicians", etc. to make
  these students see themselves as creative people.
