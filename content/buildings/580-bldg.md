          The two staggered office towers were designed with single-loaded
          corridors that supported single tenants in each wing and made
          muli-tenant floors challenging.  The south facades of the towers were
          solid brick, and the building's support functions were place along the
          south wall opening all space to the north to the glass facade and
          panoramic views.

          The building is being converted to a mixed use
          office/retail/residential complex.  Major renovations to the facade
          were necessitated to convert the building to a double-loaded function
          allowing condos to face both north and south.

The original design was the first major building to embrace the City's skywalk system by locating all major public functions at the skywalk level. The result was a street fa√ßade that was cold and impersonal. The building base was later renovated to reconnect to the street by expanding under the original street arcade and creating glass storefronts.
