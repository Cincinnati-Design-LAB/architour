It is the oldest municipal market house in Ohio and was named after General James Findlay, a former mayor of the City. As one of several markets located across the city, Findlay Market became a public gathering place and the center of the community much as suburban shopping centers do today. Although the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood declined from its original glory and became a low-income community in the second half of the Twentieth Century, the popularity of the market never declined. With Over-the-Rhine's current resurgence, the market continues to be an important catalyst for new development surrounding it.
