          Added to the NRHP on July 20, 1973.  The cathedral was elevated to a
          basilica in 1953 by Pope Pius VII and is one of only 35 in the US.

          Due to costs exceeding the original budget, the cathedral was
          dedicated in 1901 without a façade.  A wealthy patron donated
          additional funds 4 years later, and the facade was completed in 1910. 
          One of the stained glass windows is among the largest in the US at 24'
          wide by 67' high.

The Abbey Church of St Denis inspired the design of the cathedral in plan, and Notre Dame in Paris was the inspiration for the façade. Mayer Studios in Munich designed and produced the 82 stained glass windows, and local artists Frank Duveneck and Clement Barnhorn contributed murals and statues respectively to the building.
