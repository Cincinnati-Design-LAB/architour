  is among the largest in the US at 24' wide by 67' high.

The Abbey Church of St Denis inspired the design of the cathedral in plan, and Notre Dame in Paris was the inspiration for the façade. Mayer Studios in Munich designed and produced the 82 stained glass windows, and local artists Frank Duveneck and Clement Barnhorn contributed murals and statues respectively to the building.
