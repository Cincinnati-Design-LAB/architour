          A gap in the stands that aligns with Sycamore Street allows a view
          into the stadium from the downtown area.  The stadium has twin smoke
          stacks in the outfield (designed by MSA Architects) reminiscent of the
          stacks from steamboats.  When the Reds hit a home run or win a game,
          fireworks are shot out of the stacks.

Smaller than its predecessor, the new ball park is more intimate and nostalgic in character inspired by Baltimore's Camden Yards. Its external massing creates a more appropriate urban scale to relate to the adjacent Banks development and houses the Reds Hall of Fame and Museum.
