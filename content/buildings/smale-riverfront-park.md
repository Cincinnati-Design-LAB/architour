          The P&G Vibrant Playspace is at the heart of the new park.  It
          consists of a series of play rooms, each based on a theme of sound,
          light, water, and movement.  The play areas include extensive
          interactive elements including kinetic sculptures and chimes operated
          by a keyboard set in the pavement.
