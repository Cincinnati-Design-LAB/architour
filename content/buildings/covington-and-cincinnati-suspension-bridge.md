          Although the streets of Cincinnati and Covington align, the bridge was
          deliberately constructed off the grid as dictated by the Ohio
          legislature in an attempt to maintain Cincinnati's preeminence over
          the cities in northern Kentucky.  This decision would be regretted for
          years to come.  Off-ramps from the bridge once connected the bridge to
          the Dixie Terminal for streetcars, and later buses, from Kentucky to
          access Cincinnati.

At the time of construction, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world at 1057 feet. The bridge was a predecessor to the Brooklyn Bridge designed and built in 1883 by Roebling. Construction began before the beginning of the Civil War, and pressure to complete it increased due to fears of the Confederate Army launching attacks on the north. A pontoon bridge was constructed to facilitate military traffic in the short term, but the Confederate threat accelerated the flow of money from investors into the private company.
