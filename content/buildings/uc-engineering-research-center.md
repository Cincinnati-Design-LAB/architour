Michael Graves was a graduate of the College of Design, Architecture and Art (now DAAP) and is undoubtedly the most well-known of its architectural alumni. While disappointed that he was not chosen to design the expansion of DAAP, Graves accepted the challenge to design this technically complex building on a challenging site. The project began after the design of DAAP was underway and was completed prior to DAAP's completion both on-time and on-budget.
