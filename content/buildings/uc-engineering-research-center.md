          The barrel-vaulted copper roof of the building is topped with 4
          conical copper-clad stacks that accelerate exhaust from the
          laboratories into the upper levels of the atmosphere where the toxic
          fumes can be diluted and disapated.

          Public accessibility is limited to the main barrel-vaulted lobby due
          to the confidential nature of the research being pursued in the
          building.

Michael Graves was a graduate of the College of Design, Architecture and Art (now DAAP) and is undoubtedly the most well-known of its architectural alumni. While disappointed that he was not chosen to design the expansion of DAAP, Graves accepted the challenge to design this technically complex building on a challenging site. The project began after the design of DAAP was underway and was completed prior to DAAP's completion both on-time and on-budget.
