  The church features two 200-foot tall bell towers that are highly visible on
  the Covington skyline.  Based on medieval German churches, the "hall church"
  has side aisles that are nearly as tall as the nave so that large
  stained-glass windows flood the church with daylight. Tall, slender cast-iron
  columns make the space seem expansive and unified.

Originally serving as a church for German immigrants, the congregation continues to grow in large part to its community involvement. Johann Schmitt painted 5 murals in the church in 1890 depicting the Five Joyful Mysteries as part of the church's golden jubiliee. Local sculpters, Frederick and Henry Schroeder, hand carved the wooden alters.
