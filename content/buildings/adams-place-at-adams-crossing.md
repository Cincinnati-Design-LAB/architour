The building was the first phase of a masterplan to develop the Cincinnati riverfront east of downtown into a new residential zone. It was one of the first luxury urban condominium projects to be built in Cincinnati. Turnbull and Doran initially conceived the masterplan as a series of lower scale buildings that terraced similar to Italian hill towns, but the initial scheme did not achieve the density necessary to make the development economically viable. The high-rise condo towers were added to create the needed density and critical mass for the first phase of the project.
