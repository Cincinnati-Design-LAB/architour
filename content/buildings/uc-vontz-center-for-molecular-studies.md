The building has an ordered plan to accommodate the various laboratories within that belies the articulated curving fa√ßade characteristic of Gehry-designed buildings. Challenged with designing a brick building to reflect UC's historic character, Gehry and his team developed a panelized preformed brick facade system that could be factory built to achieve the challenging geometry of the building.
