It was the first reinforced concrete highrise in the world at 16 stories. Prior to its construction, the tallest reinforced concrete building was only 6 stories. The building was considered a "daring engineering feat at the time," and it took some time to convince city officials to issue a building permit because they were convinced the building would collapse from its own weight.
