Constructed in 1903, this Beaux Arts building was originally established as the German National Bank but was renamed Lincoln National Bank in 1918 due to anti-German sentiments and later merged with Fifth Third Bank in 1955. The building showcases notable architectural elements such as prominent Doric pilasters on its corners, a robust base with large storefronts, a central entrance featuring a pediment awning, arched window bays on the second floor with Ionic columns, and decorative cornices. Designated as a contributing structure in the West Fourth Street Historic District, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Today it is a Starbucks.
