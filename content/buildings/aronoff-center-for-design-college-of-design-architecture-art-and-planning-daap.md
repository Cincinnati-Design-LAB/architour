          Purportedly the design of the building was meant to demonstrate the
          power of architecture to the students.  Eisenman stated that vertical
          spaces were designed to create a sense of vertigo.  A staircase in the
          college library that curves and has walls that taper inward is
          difficult to climb without becoming disoriented.  The building is
          intentionally difficult to navigate.

          The building was reclad with an aluminum panel system due to the poor
          performance of the synthetic plaster system.  The basic color coding
          of the original design was maintained.

An iconic building, the Aronoff Center created a new image for the UC campus at its northwest corner. The building wraps around two existing buildings to create the complex with a cascading and curving atrium in between that serves as critique space and areas for students to gather. According to Peter Eisenman, the building's form was generated by a series of geometric computer manipulations and not by human intellect. The building is highly inwardly focused and turns its back on the public part to the north.
