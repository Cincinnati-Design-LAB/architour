          A 225' long two-level arcade connects the Fourth Street entry to the
          river view at the rear and is reminiscent of New York's Pennsylvania
          Station.  Its vaulted ceiling is painted with teal accents and trimmed
          in gold.

          At its opening, the Cincinnati Enquirer called the building a
          "splendid structure in which utility and beauty are combined.  The
          power of public-spirited wealth and the dignity of labor have united
          to meet a public need, to render a public service, to bestow a civic
          adornment and thus to furnish a happy augury of a new era in
          Cincinnati's progress."

The building's name stems from its original function as a streetcar and bus terminus for Northern Kentucky's transit system. It once housed the Cincinnati Stock Exchange.
