The building follows the classic tripartite form with a 3-story doric columned base, a 16-story tower, and a pyramidal top. Reminiscent of the Union Central Life Building also designed by Garber & Woodward, the pyramidal roof inspired the architects of the Cincinnati Times Star Building in 1933 and the P&G twin towers in 1985.
