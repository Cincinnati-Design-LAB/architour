original_owner: Cincinnati Parks Board
completion_date: '1976'
architect: Louis Sauer
original_function: >-
  An interactive fountain and water parked designed to engage the community and
  create a thrilling waterpark-like experience similar to those created in San
  Francisco and Portland around the same period.
unique_features: >-
  A large L-shaped concrete tower sprayed water intermittently across a shallow
  pool toward the stepped seating on the east.  Large concrete monoliths flowed
  with water from their tops to create simulated waterfalls.
renovations: >-
  The original design required a lifeguard to be present, and the Cincinnati
  Recreation Commission modified the fountain to eliminate that requirement by
  topping the shallow pool, closing off an upper plaza, and adding fencing
  around the edges of the fountain.
