          A large L-shaped concrete tower sprayed water intermittently across a
          shallow pool toward the stepped seating on the east.  Large concrete
          monoliths flowed with water from their tops to create simulated
          waterfalls.

          An interactive fountain and water parked designed to engage the
          community and create a thrilling waterpark-like experience similar to
          those created in San Francisco and Portland around the same period.

          The original design required a lifeguard to be present, and the
          Cincinnati Recreation Commission modified the fountain to eliminate
          that requirement by topping the shallow pool, closing off an upper
          plaza, and adding fencing around the edges of the fountain.
