          The National Steamboat Mounument is located at the beginning of the
          park on the west side of the Public Landing.  The paddle wheel is an
          exact replica of the one that propelled the American Queen.  Suspended
          40 feet in the air, the sculpture is surrounded by 24 metal stacks
          that are whistles to emulate the sounds of a riverboat in what is
          known as the Dan and Susan Pfau Whistle Grove.  The whistles are
          triggered by motion, and they emit steam as they sound.

          A riverfront part that stretches from the Public Landing to the L&N
          Bridge. The park includes a public lawn, a spray park, the National
          Steamboat Memorial, and the Serpentine Wall.  It is frequently used as
          the center of public events on the riverfront.
