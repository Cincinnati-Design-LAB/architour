          The main theater has been designed for flexibility and can be
          configured several ways ranging from a thrust formation mirroring the
          Globe Theatre to theatre-in-the-round.  Designed for an intimate
          experience, the theater has a maximum of 6 rows placing every patron
          within 20 feet of the stage.  The balcony has a single row of seats to
          provide the best views.  The building has also been designed to reveal
          the interior activities to the public in Washington Park.  The primary
          rehearsal space is located on the second floor open to the park and
          the streets below.  The building subtly references Shakespeare's
          career in large gestures such as creating a similar feeling to the
          Globe in the main theater and referencing Shakespeare's 38 plays by
          using 38 steps to access the balcony from the main floor with the
          names of his plays etched in the stair risers.

          "We are excited about the Cincinnati Shakespeare Company building its
          new home in OTR because their resident actors and actresses will
          thrive as members of the neighborhood's blossoming creative class.
          Further, the building will create a much-needed world-class venue for
          start-ups and entrepreneurs to leverage for events and meeting space.
          With the addition of the Shakespeare Company, no other neighborhood in
          America will be able to provide comparable live, work, and play
          opportunities for the creative class."  Rob McDonald, The Brandery
