This sculpture or as Julian Stanczak wife defines it a mural, is named "Additional". This piece is located on the side of the Fifth Third Bank’s Fountain Square above-level parking garage and was created in 2007.



This sculpture is made out of 522 hallow aluminum bars that are bright and colorful. There are 325 vertical strips, each painted in one of three similar colors on their sides. Depending on your perspective—whether you’re walking past them or facing them—you might see them as either green or purple, or a combination of both. This serves as a prime example of how color combinations can influence perception. (The visual effect is momentarily disrupted by a prominent decorative feature situated above a doorway.) To enhance the illusion of depth even further, there are also 200 angled bars of different colors that intersect with the vertical strips. This arrangement creates the impression that they are swaying in the wind.
