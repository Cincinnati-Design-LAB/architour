          The master plan resulted in creating a series of open and landscaped
          places on the campus that includes McMicken Comons, Library Square,
          MainStreet, Sigma Sigma Commons, and University Commons.  The Campus
          Green at the northeast corner of the campus was previously a massive
          parking lot and represents one of the most significant improvements to
          the campus.  In addition to the open lawns and pathways, the new green
          space includes geometric land forms, an amphitheatre, an arboretium,
          seating areas, a bosque of trees and the Sigma Sigma Tower.

          The insertion of green space throughout the campus has helped to
          reduce the heat-island effect and its impact on its buildings,
          students, and faculty. The elimination of large, paved parking lots
          that retain heat and replacement with parking decks contributes
          greatly to its success.

When UC initiated the Signature Architect program, the university recognized that the spaces between the buildings were as important as the new buildings in creating an improved image for the campus. As many recogized, there was no sense of place on the campus, and it had been dominated by the auto and parking requirements. To create the quality of environment desired, selective demolition of buildings was necessary as well as the elimination of parking lots. Green space was added, and parking garages were constructed to free up land. The new campus has a more park-like feeling, and improvements continue to be made with each new building.
