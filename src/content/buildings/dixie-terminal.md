  A 225' long two-level arcade connects the Fourth Street entry to the river
  view at the rear and is reminiscent of New York's Pennsylvania Station.  Its
  vaulted ceiling is painted with teal accents and trimmed in gold. 

  ### Quotes

  At its opening, the Cincinnati Enquirer called the building a "splendid
  structure in which utility and beauty are combined.  The power of
  public-spirited wealth and the dignity of labor have united to meet a public
  need, to render a public service, to bestow a civic adornment and thus to
  furnish a happy augury of a new era in Cincinnati's progress."

  ### Renovations

  Upper levels of the building were renovated to provide additional office space
  for Great American Insurance comparable to the space in the new Great American
  Tower.

  ### Renovation Date

  KZF Design

  ### Renovation Changes

  The transportation terminal was closed in 1998 and is primarily used as a
