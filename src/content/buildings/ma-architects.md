  with other organizations in the community by being located in a walkable
  neighborhood on the streetcar route with access to other design firms in the
  area.  The firm also enjoys access to Washington Park and the nearly nightly
  events that occur there during the summer.

  ### Renovation Changes

  The Cincinnati office of a Columbus-based firm offers architectural, interior
  design, graphic design, and masterplanning services based on their "smart
  design" concept.

  ### Green Building Features

  The existing building has been repurposed, and much of the original shell has
  been preserved.  Operable windows provide excellent daylighting and natural
  ventilation to the space, and energy consumption has been reduced through the
  incorporation of LED lighting throughout the space.
