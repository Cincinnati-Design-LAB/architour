  Richardsonian Romanesque

  ### Architect

  Samuel Hannaford & Sons, one of Cincinnati's most prolific 19th Century
  architects who also designed Cincinnati City Hall and Music Hall.

  ### Original Function

  City offices and Council chambers

  ### Significance

  In 1884, Cincinnati experienced a courthouse riot followed by a labor riot two
  years later.  Downtown residents were concerned about trends toward violence,
  and a new mayor was elected to gain control.  The design of the new City Hall
  was intended to stand as a symbol of the government's power.

  ### Historic Status

  Listed on NRHP on December 11, 1972.

  ### Unique Features

  Referencing the work of H. H. Richardson, the muscular style of the building
  creates an impression of strength, stability, and power.  The tower, turrets,
  massive arches, and scale of the materials suggest a fortress-like quality.  A
  large courtyard is located in the center of the building and has been studied
  for enclosure.
