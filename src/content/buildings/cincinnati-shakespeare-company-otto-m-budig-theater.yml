  Theater and event center (starting in 2018) for weddings, lectures, community

  ### Significance

  The building anchors and activates through its transparency the southwest
  corner of Washington Park and is a complement to the School for Creative and
  Performing Arts, Memorial Hall and Music Hall.

  ### Unique Features

  The main theater has been designed for flexibility and can be configured
  several ways ranging from a thrust formation mirroring the Globe Theatre to
  theatre-in-the-round.  Designed for an intimate experience, the theater has a
  maximum of 6 rows placing every patron within 20 feet of the stage.  The
  balcony has a single row of seats to provide the best views.  The building has
  also been designed to reveal the interior activities to the public in
  Washington Park.  The primary rehearsal space is located on the second floor
  open to the park and the streets below.  The building subtly references
  Shakespeare's career in large gestures such as creating a similar feeling to
  the Globe in the main theater and referencing Shakespeare's 38 plays by using
  38 steps to access the balcony from the main floor with the names of his plays
  etched in the stair risers.

  ### Quotes

  "We are excited about the Cincinnati Shakespeare Company building its new home
  in OTR because their resident actors and actresses will thrive as members of
  the neighborhood's blossoming creative class.  Further, the building will
  create a much-needed world-class venue for start-ups and entrepreneurs to
  leverage for events and meeting space.  With the addition of the Shakespeare
  Company, no other neighborhood in America will be able to provide comparable
  live, work, and play opportunities for the creative class."  Rob McDonald, The
  Brandery
