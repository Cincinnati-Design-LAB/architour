  ### Name

  Tri State Bldg (Traction Building)

  ### Address

  432 Walnut St., Cincinnati, Ohio

  ### Date of Completion

  1902

  ### Style

  Chicago School

  ### Architect

  Daniel Burnham, a Chicago-based architect whose firm also designed the Rookery
  Building  in Chicago, the Flatiron Building in New York City, and Union
  Station in Washington, DC.

  ### Unique Features

  The building follows the classic tripartite form typical of the Chicago style
  with minimal detail.  The smooth granite base constrasts with the rusticated
  brick detail of the building shaft accentuating each floor line contrasted
  with the terra cotta capital in white.  The contrast created a clarity of
  intention that is unique in Burnham's work in Cincinnati.
