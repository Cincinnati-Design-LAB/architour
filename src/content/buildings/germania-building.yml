  ### Significance

  The first floor hall served as a home for the many German-American societies
  that existed in Cincinnati at the time.  It became a target of anti-German
  sentiment as the US entered WW2. The company name was changed to the Hamilton
  County Mutual Fire Insurance Company of Cincinnati, and the sculpture of
  Germania was renamed Columbia.

  ### Unique Features

  A sculpture of Germania, the German symbol of culture and spirit, is
  integrated into the fa√ßade.  The sculpture was designed by Cincinnatian
  Leopold Fettweis.
