  ### Name

  Yeatman's Cove at Sawyer Point

  ### Address

  705 E. Pete Rose Way, Cincinnati, OH  45202

  ### Original Owner

  Cincinnati Parks Board

  ### Date of Completion

  1977

  ### Architect

  Zion & Breen

  ### Original Function

  A riverfront part that stretches from the Public Landing to the L&N Bridge. 
  The park includes a public lawn, a spray park, the National Steamboat
  Memorial, and the Serpentine Wall.  It is frequently used as the center of
  public events on the riverfront.

  ### Significance

  The park was the first development on the riverfront to provide public access
  to the river.  

  ### Unique Features

  The National Steamboat Mounument is located at the beginning of the park on
  the west side of the Public Landing.  The paddle wheel is an exact replica of
  the one that propelled the American Queen.  Suspended 40 feet in the air, the
  sculpture is surrounded by 24 metal stacks that are whistles to emulate the
  sounds of a riverboat in what is known as the Dan and Susan Pfau Whistle
  Grove.  The whistles are triggered by motion, and they emit steam as they
  sound.
