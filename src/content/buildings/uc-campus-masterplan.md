  ### Significance

  When UC initiated the Signature Architect program, the university recognized
  that the spaces between the buildings were as important as the new buildings
  in creating an improved image for the campus.  As many recogized, there was no
  sense of place on the campus, and it had been dominated by the auto and
  parking requirements. To create the quality of environment desired, selective
  demolition of buildings was necessary as well as the elimination of parking
  lots.  Green space was added, and parking garages were constructed to free up
  land. The new campus has a more park-like feeling, and improvements continue
  to be made with each new building.  

  ### Unique Features

  The master plan resulted in creating a series of open and landscaped places on
  the campus that includes McMicken Comons, Library Square, MainStreet, Sigma
  Sigma Commons, and University Commons.  The Campus Green at the northeast
  corner of the campus was previously a massive parking lot and represents one
  of the most significant improvements to the campus.  In addition to the open
  lawns and pathways, the new green space includes geometric land forms, an
  amphitheatre, an arboretium, seating areas, a bosque of trees and the Sigma
  Sigma Tower. 

  ### Green Building Features

  The insertion of green space throughout the campus has helped to reduce the
  heat-island effect and its impact on its buildings, students, and faculty. 
  The elimination of large, paved parking lots that retain heat and replacement
  with parking decks contributes greatly to its success.
