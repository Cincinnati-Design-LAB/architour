  John A. Roebling (Chief Engineer)  Roebling also owned the wire company and
  the spinning machines that were used to create the steel suspension cables
  used on the bridge.
significance: >-
  At the time of construction, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world
  at 1057 feet. The bridge was a predecessor to the Brooklyn Bridge designed and
  built in 1883 by Roebling.  Construction began before the beginning of the
  Civil War, and pressure to complete it increased due to fears of the
  Confederate Army launching attacks on the north.  A pontoon bridge was
  constructed to facilitate military traffic in the short term, but the
  Confederate threat accelerated the flow of money from investors into the
  private company.
historic_status: Listed in NRHP on May 15, 1975
unique_features: >-
  Although the streets of Cincinnati and Covington align, the bridge was
  deliberately constructed off the grid as dictated by the Ohio legislature in
  an attempt to maintain Cincinnati's preeminence over the cities in northern
  Kentucky.  This decision would be regretted for years to come.  Off-ramps from
  the bridge once connected the bridge to the Dixie Terminal for streetcars, and
  later buses, from Kentucky to access Cincinnati.
renovations: Structural enhancement of the bridge to accomodate an urban railway.
