  ### Name

  John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge (Covington and Cincinnati Suspension
  Bridge)

  ### Address

  , Cincinnati, Ohio

  ### Original Owner

  The Covington and Cincinnati Bridge Company (a private company)

  ### Current Owner

  Commonwealth of Kentucky

  ### Date of Completion

  1867

  ### Architect

  John A. Roebling (Chief Engineer)  Roebling also owned the wire company and
  the spinning machines that were used to create the steel suspension cables
  used on the bridge.

  ### Significance

  At the time of construction, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world
  at 1057 feet. The bridge was a predecessor to the Brooklyn Bridge designed and
  built in 1883 by Roebling.  Construction began before the beginning of the
  Civil War, and pressure to complete it increased due to fears of the
  Confederate Army launching attacks on the north.  A pontoon bridge was
  constructed to facilitate military traffic in the short term, but the
  Confederate threat accelerated the flow of money from investors into the
  private company. 

  ### Historic Status

  Listed in NRHP on May 15, 1975

  ### Unique Features

  Although the streets of Cincinnati and Covington align, the bridge was
  deliberately constructed off the grid as dictated by the Ohio legislature in
  an attempt to maintain Cincinnati's preeminence over the cities in northern
  Kentucky.  This decision would be regretted for years to come.  Off-ramps from
  the bridge once connected the bridge to the Dixie Terminal for streetcars, and
  later buses, from Kentucky to access Cincinnati.

  ### Renovations

  Structural enhancement of the bridge to accomodate an urban railway.

  ### Renovation Date

  1898

  ### Renovation Architect

  William Hildenbrandt
