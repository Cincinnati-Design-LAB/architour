"From its beginning, the church was well known for its liberal theology and social outlook. In 1946, due to the decreasing attendance and changes in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, the congregation moved to its home in Clifton, where it still exists as St. John's Unitarian Universalist Church." From "A Walking Tour of Over-the-Rhine West" by the Cincinnati Preservation Association.
