  The building is the home of the Mercantile Library, a private library
  established in 1845 for the use of its members who were pursuing mercantile
  careers. The library was located in the Cincinnati College building.  The
  original building burned, but the books were saved.  When the building was
  being reconstructed, Judge Alfonso Taft, the father of the President and
  attorney for the college, negotiated a lease for the library that allowed it
  to remain for 10,000 years free of rent.  The 1845 building was demolished and
  reconstructed to create a larger building, and the library's lease was
  maintained.  It was relocated to the upper floors of the building where it
  continues to operate today as a private library.
