  ### Name

  Otto Armleder Memorial Aquatic Fountain

  ### Address

  472 E Pete Rose Way, Cincinnati, OH 45202

  ### Original Owner

  Cincinnati Parks Board

  ### Date of Completion

  1976

  ### Architect

  Louis Sauer

  ### Original Function

  An interactive fountain and water parked designed to engage the community and
  create a thrilling waterpark-like experience similar to those created in San
  Francisco and Portland around the same period. 

  ### Unique Features

  A large L-shaped concrete tower sprayed water intermittently across a shallow
  pool toward the stepped seating on the east.  Large concrete monoliths flowed
  with water from their tops to create simulated waterfalls.

  ### Renovations

  The original design required a lifeguard to be present, and the Cincinnati
  Recreation Commission modified the fountain to eliminate that requirement by
  topping the shallow pool, closing off an upper plaza, and adding fencing
  around the edges of the fountain.

  ### Renovation Date

  2009
