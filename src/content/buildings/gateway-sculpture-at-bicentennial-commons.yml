  Garth Rockcastle & Andrew Leicester

  ### Original Function

  An environmental sculpture designed to showcase Cincinnati's connection to the
  Ohio River

  ### Unique Features

  The whimsical environmental sculpture was designed by the Minneapolis-based
  team of artist Andrew Leicester in conjuction with architect Garth
  Rockcastle.  As visitors enter the park, they pass through a symbolic canal
  boat lock under a bridge anchored by columns desiged to look like smoke stacks
  from the steam boats that frequented the city.  These columns are topped with
  sculptures of winged "flying pigs", a reference to Cincinnati's days as a
  meat-packing center when it received the nickname, "Porkopolis".  The focal
  point is the flood column that depicts the history of three significant floods
  and is topped by a ark as a symbol of the surviving the floods.  Atop the
  undulating wall is a scaled replica of the Ohio River as it stretches from
  Pittsburgh to Cairo with Cincinnati at the center.  The fountain stream
  depicts the dams, locks and bridges that cross the river.  The crowns
  suspended from the "tall stack" columns represents Cincinnati's place as the
  Queen City of the West.
