significance: >-
  It is the oldest park in Cincinnati.  Located in the center of the street, the
  park spans two downtown blocks.  John and Benjamin Piatt originally donated
  the land for a public market, but the one located on Sixth Street was deemed
  too close to make this site viable.
unique_features: >-
  A bronze statue of James A. Garfield (1887) by Charles Henry Niehaus faces
  Vine Street on the east end of the park, an a second bronze statue of William
  Henry Harrison (1896) by Louis T. Rebisso is located on the west end facing
  Elm Street.  Two circular fountains are located on either side of Race Street
  in the center of the park, and sculptures (1989) by local artist Stuart Fink
  are incorporated in the pools of each fountain.
