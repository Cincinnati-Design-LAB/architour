original_function: >-
  Bank and office building with a retail function at the skywalk (second floor)
  level.
significance: >-
  The original design was the first major building to embrace the City's skywalk
  system by locating all major public functions at the skywalk level.  The
  result was a street faÃ§ade that was cold and impersonal.  The building base
  was later renovated to reconnect to the street by expanding under the original
  street arcade and creating glass storefronts.
unique_features: >-
  The two staggered office towers were designed with single-loaded corridors
  that supported single tenants in each wing and made muli-tenant floors
  challenging.  The south facades of the towers were solid brick, and the
  building's support functions were place along the south wall opening all space
  to the north to the glass facade and panoramic views.
renovation_date: "2016"
renovation_changes: >-
  The building is being converted to a mixed use office/retail/residential
  complex.  Major renovations to the facade were necessitated to convert the
  building to a double-loaded function allowing condos to face both north and
  south.
