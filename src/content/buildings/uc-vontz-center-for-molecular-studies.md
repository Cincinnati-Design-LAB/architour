  ### Name

  UC Vontz Center for Molecular Studies

  ### Original Owner

  University of Cincinnati

  ### Date of Completion

  1999

  ### Style

  Modern

  ### Interior Accessibility

  The building is not accessible to the public due to the confidential research
  that is pursued in the building.

  ### Architect

  Frank Gehry

  ### Associate Architect

  BHDP Architecture

  ### Original Function

  Molecular reseach laboratories

  ### Significance

  The building has an ordered plan to accommodate the various laboratories
  within that belies the articulated curving fa√ßade characteristic of
  Gehry-designed buildings.  Challenged with designing a brick building to
  reflect UC's historic character,  Gehry and his team developed a panelized
  preformed brick facade system that could be factory built to achieve the
  challenging geometry of the building.  

  ### Unique Features

  The building has a central atrium with stair that connects the varying
  laboratory levels to encourage researchers to collaborate with each other.
