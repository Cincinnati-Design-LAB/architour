significance: >-
  While P&G originally desired to build the tallest building in Cincinnati, they
  were challenged by the City to build the best building instead. The innovative
  design created an anchor for the east end of the CBD as well as a symbolic
  gateway to the City from the east.
unique_features: >-
  The building has a second level concourse that is connected to the original
  building by an elevated walkway.  The concourse is a pedestrian street lined
  with services for P&G employees and terminates in a major dining space at the
  intersection of the twin towers.
