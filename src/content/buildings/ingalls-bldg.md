  ### Significance

  It was the first reinforced concrete highrise in the world at 16 stories. 
  Prior to its construction, the tallest reinforced concrete building was only 6
  stories. The building was considered a "daring engineering feat at the time,"
  and it took some time to convince city officials to issue a building permit
  because they were convinced the building would collapse from its own weight. 

  ### Historic Status

  Listed on NRHP on March 7, 1975.

  ### Unique Features

  The building is essentially a concrete box with walls, floors, columns, and
  beams constructed in concrete with reinforcing steel.

  ### Renovation Changes

  Current owner proposed converting the building to condominiums, but these
  plans were suspended and the building listed for sale in 2015.
