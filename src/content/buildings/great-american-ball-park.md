significance: >-
  Smaller than its predecessor, the new ball park is more intimate and nostalgic
  in character inspired by Baltimore's Camden Yards.  Its external massing
  creates a more appropriate urban scale to relate to the adjacent Banks
  development and houses the Reds Hall of Fame and Museum.
unique_features: >-
  A gap in the stands that aligns with Sycamore Street allows a view into the
  stadium from the downtown area.  The stadium has twin smoke stacks in the
  outfield (designed by MSA Architects) reminiscent of the stacks from
  steamboats.  When the Reds hit a home run or win a game, fireworks are shot
  out of the stacks.
