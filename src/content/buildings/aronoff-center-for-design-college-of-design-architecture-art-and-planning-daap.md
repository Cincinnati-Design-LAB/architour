  Purportedly the design of the building was meant to demonstrate the power of
  architecture to the students.  Eisenman stated that vertical spaces were
  designed to create a sense of vertigo.  A staircase in the college library
  that curves and has walls that taper inward is difficult to climb without
  becoming disoriented.  The building is intentionally difficult to navigate.
renovations: >-
  The building was reclad with an aluminum panel system due to the poor
  performance of the synthetic plaster system.  The basic color coding of the
  original design was maintained.

An iconic building, the Aronoff Center created a new image for the UC campus at its northwest corner. The building wraps around two existing buildings to create the complex with a cascading and curving atrium in between that serves as critique space and areas for students to gather. According to Peter Eisenman, the building's form was generated by a series of geometric computer manipulations and not by human intellect. The building is highly inwardly focused and turns its back on the public part to the north.
