significance: >-
  The building was the first phase of a masterplan to develop the Cincinnati
  riverfront east of downtown into a new residential zone.  It was one of the
  first luxury urban condominium projects to be built in Cincinnati.  Turnbull
  and Doran initially conceived the masterplan as a series of lower scale
  buildings that terraced similar to Italian hill towns, but the initial scheme
  did not achieve the density necessary to make the development economically
  viable.  The high-rise condo towers were added to create the needed density
  and critical mass for the first phase of the project.
unique_features: >-
  The building is actually constructed as two towers connected by a bridge.  The
  large condo units feature extensive painted woodwork creating a sense of
  refinement in the large-scale building.
