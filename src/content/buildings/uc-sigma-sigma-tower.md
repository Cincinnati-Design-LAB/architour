  ### Name

  UC Ronald F. Walker Tower at Sigma Sigma Commons

  ### Original Owner

  University of Cincinnati

  ### Interior Accessibility

  The tower is located in the Sigma Sigma Commons and can be viewed at all times
  of the day and night.

  ### Architect

  Machado & Silvetti

  ### Original Function

  Light tower dedicated to a member of the Sigma Sigma Fraternity, a men's honor
  society.

  ### Significance

  The Sigma Sigma Commons and the Ronald F. Walker Tower were funded by the
  honorary fraternity Sigma Sigma.  It raised $1.8 million to fund the project
  in a campaign that lasted only 3 months!  The 3.5 acre site is a magnet for
  student activity and includes an amphitheater that seats 1,850 people for
  special performances.

  ### Unique Features

  "The tower has a number of symbolic aspects in its design. Its square base
  forms the letters U and C on alternating sides. Above these letters, the main
  wooden shafts rise in the form of hammers. These motifs reflect the
  fraternity's motto, "The torch burns; the hammers ring." At the top, a beam of
  light shines through a stylized stainless steel torch and changes colors
  through the use of a computer program."  Source:
