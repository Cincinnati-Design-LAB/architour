original_owner: University of Cincinnati
date_of_completion: "1995"
style: Post-Modern
interior_accessibility: >-
  Public accessibility is limited to the main barrel-vaulted lobby due to the
  confidential nature of the research being pursued in the building.
architect: Michael Graves
associate_architect: KZF Design
original_function: Engineering research laboratories
significance: >-
  Michael Graves was a graduate of the College of Design, Architecture and Art
  (now DAAP) and is undoubtedly the most well-known of its architectural alumni.
  While disappointed that he was not chosen to design the expansion of DAAP,
  Graves accepted the challenge to design this technically complex building on a
  challenging site.  The project began after the design of DAAP was underway and
  was completed prior to DAAP's completion both on-time and on-budget.
unique_features: >-
  The barrel-vaulted copper roof of the building is topped with 4 conical
  copper-clad stacks that accelerate exhaust from the laboratories into the
  upper levels of the atmosphere where the toxic fumes can be diluted and
  disapated.
