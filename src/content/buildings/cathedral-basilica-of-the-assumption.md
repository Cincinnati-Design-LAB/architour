significance: >-
  The Abbey Church of St Denis inspired the design of the cathedral in plan, and
  Notre Dame in Paris was the inspiration for the façade.  Mayer Studios in
  Munich designed and produced the 82  stained glass windows, and local artists
  Frank Duveneck and Clement Barnhorn contributed murals and statues
  respectively to the building.
historic_status: >-
  Added to the NRHP on July 20, 1973.  The cathedral was elevated to a basilica
  in 1953 by Pope Pius VII and is one of only 35 in the US.
unique_features: >-
  Due to costs exceeding the original budget, the cathedral was dedicated in
  1901 without a façade.  A wealthy patron donated additional funds 4 years
  later, and the facade was completed in 1910.  One of the stained glass windows
  is among the largest in the US at 24' wide by 67' high.
