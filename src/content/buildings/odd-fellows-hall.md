  The building played an important role during the Civil War serving as the home
  for Kentucky's Union Party and housing Confederate prisoners.  It has also
  been home to the Covington Theater, the Tusculan Literary Society, Chautauqua
  lectures, Vaudeville performances, religious congregations, boxing matches, a
  nightclub, and a roller skating rink.

unique_features: >-
  The upper floors have no interior columns, and iron rods supporated by 2-foot
  thick exterior walls support the floors.  This unusual structural technique
  has been attributed to John Roebling who had a connection with Amos Shinkle,
  one of the lodge members who was partly responsible for getting the building
  constructed.
