  ### Significance

  The design of the complex weaves together several existing buildings with
  infill structures and landscape treatments to create a cohesive environment or
  "village" as it is known today.  CCM is noted as one of the top music
  conseratories in the country, and the renovated and expanded facilities offer
  performance and education spaces commensurate with the college's stature. 
  Major performance spaces include a concert hall, a recital hall, a theatre,
  and a black box performance facility.

  ### Unique Features

  The building complex masterfully weaves multiple levels of the camput
  together, and its design reflects the vertical nature of the UC campus.  In
  particular, the new 250-seat Robert J. Werner Recital Hall mitigates between
  CCM and the adjacent Nippert Stadium and provides dramatic views into the
  stadium from its prefunction space.
