This highly complex building weaves disparate parts of the campus together. The dormitory wing creates a foil in front of the old fieldhouse creating a new image at this important entry point to the campus. The student recreation facilities jut out with folded roof forms and create an edge to the extended campus green allowing pedestrians to interact with the building. And the classroom wing engages the stadium and creates one side of a pedestrian canyon that connects to the student union and the heart of the campus. The building was rated as the best student athletic facility in the US.
