  ### Name

  UC Campus Recreation Center

  ### Original Owner

  University of Cincinnati

  ### Date of Completion

  2006

  ### Interior Accessibility

  The lobby and exterior courtyards are open to the public and provide views
  into the facility, but access to the exercise areas is restricted.

  ### Architect

  Morphosis

  ### Associate Architect

  KZF Design

  ### Original Function

  Multi-use facility housing athletic facilities, student housing, and
  classrooms.

  ### Significance

  This highly complex building weaves disparate parts of the campus together. 
  The dormitory wing creates a foil in front of the old fieldhouse creating a
  new image at this important entry point to the campus.  The student recreation
  facilities jut out with folded roof forms and create an edge to the extended
  campus green allowing pedestrians to interact with the building.  And the
  classroom wing engages the stadium and creates one side of a pedestrian canyon
  that connects to the student union and the heart of the campus.  The building
  was rated as the best student athletic facility in the US. 

  ### Unique Features

  The athletic facilities are designed with a transparency between activities so
  that users can always see people engaged in other types of exercise.  The
  building is also infused with daylight using clerestory lites and holes
  punched through the roof forms at strategic locations.
