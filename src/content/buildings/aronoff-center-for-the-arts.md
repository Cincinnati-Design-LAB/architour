  The complex is composed of 3 theatres to support varying performance
  requirements.  The Procter & Gamble Hall is a 2,700 seat theatre primarily
  used for traveling Broadway shows, the ballet, and other musical and comedic
  performances.  The smaller Jarson-Kaplan Theatre seats 437 and is used for
  more intimate performances and corporate presentations.  The Fifth Third
  Theatre is a black box type space that can seat up to 150 people for
  alternative performances.
