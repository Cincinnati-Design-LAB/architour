  ### Original Function

  1910 building facing Jackson St. was a furniture factory & warehouse for the
  John Shillito Company.   The 1923 building housed the Samuel Rosenthal
  Company, the oldest printing and publishing firm in Cincinnati.

  ### Significance

  The Art Academy of Cincinnati was one of the first institutions to relocate
  into Over-the-Rhine and led the way for the rebirth of the area.

  ### Unique Features

  The school was relocated from the Cincinnati Art Museum, and the architects
  created references to the former location.  For example, treads from a stair
  were relocated and placed in the floor of the lobby so that everyone who
  enters the building crosses the old stair treads.  Other treads were used to
  create benches throughout the facility.  The central lightwell includes a
  staircase that is rotated 7 degrees to align with the former building at the
  Art Museum.  This lightwell brings daylight deep into the building.  The
  perimeter of the building is composed of industrial sash windows that also
  provide high quality daylight into the studios.
