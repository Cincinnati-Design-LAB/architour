  The National Steamboat Mounument is located at the beginning of the park on

  the one that propelled the American Queen.  Suspended 40 feet in the air, the
  sculpture is surrounded by 24 metal stacks that are whistles to emulate the
  sounds of a riverboat in what is known as the Dan and Susan Pfau Whistle
  Grove.  The whistles are triggered by motion, and they emit steam as they
  sound.
