  ### Name

  MainStrasse Village

  ### Address

  6th St. & Main St.

  Covington KY

  ### Significance

  Originally settled by German and Irish immigrants before the Civil War, the
  community declined in the mid-Twentieth Century only to be revived later in
  the same century.  Today, it is a vibrant community with shops and restaurants
  serving a young professional population.  Many of the homes were built between
  the 1840s and 1870s.

  ### Historic Status

  The West Side - Main Strasse Historic District was added to the NRHP on
  November 10, 1983.  It is roughly bounded by the Chesapeake & Ohio railroad
  line and 6th, Philadelphia, Dalton, Pike, and Robbins Sts.

  ### Renovations

  In 1975, a federal grant of $2.5 million helped to kick-start the
  redevelopment of the neighborhood.
