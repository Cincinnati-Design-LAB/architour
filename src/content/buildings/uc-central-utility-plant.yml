  ### Style

  Modern

  Campus power center generating electricity, steam and chilled water

  ### Significance

  The new facility was constructed to replace the facility previously located at
  the end of Nippert Stadium facilitating the development of the new student
  athletic center.  The facility is centrally located between the main campus
  and the medical campus to support both.  

  ### Unique Features

  The main boiler and chiller plant is glazed allowing views into the building
  from the surrounding streets.  These massive systems were celebrated as part
  of the architecture rather than being concealed by a translucent or opaque
  fa√ßade.

  ### Renovations

  A 72,00 s.f. vertical and horizontal expansion of the facility dramatically
  increased the capacity of the facility.

  ### Renovation Date

  2004
