significance: >-
  Originally serving as a church for German immigrants, the congregation
  continues to grow in large part to its community involvement.  Johann Schmitt
  painted 5 murals in the church in 1890 depicting the Five Joyful Mysteries as
  part of the church's golden jubiliee.  Local sculpters, Frederick and Henry
  Schroeder, hand carved the wooden alters.
historic_status: Added to NRHP on May 29, 1980
unique_features: >-
  The church features two 200-foot tall bell towers that are highly visible on
  the Covington skyline.  Based on medieval German churches, the "hall church"
  has side aisles that are nearly as tall as the nave so that large
  stained-glass windows flood the church with daylight. Tall, slender cast-iron
  columns make the space seem expansive and unified.
