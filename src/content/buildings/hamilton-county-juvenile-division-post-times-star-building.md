  "The scuptural program by Ernest B. Haswell and Jules Brys is rich in
  literary, historical, and mythological references to journalism and learning. 
  It offers the view a measure of mystery and visual delight found in a medieval
  church.  The canted corners of the tower project three-dimensional figures in
  a manner that recalls Bertram Goodhue's popular Nebraska State Capitol (ca.
  1922).  Large bas-reliefs below the statuary contain profile portraits of
  printing icons, including Franklin and Gutenberg.  Carved panels of shields
  guraded by winged lions adorn the lower levels."  from Architecture in
  Cincinnati, Sue Ann Painter, Ohio University Press in association with the
  Architectural Foundation of Cincinnati.
