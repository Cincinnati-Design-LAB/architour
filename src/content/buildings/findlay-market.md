significance: >-
  It is the oldest municipal market house in Ohio and was named after General
  James Findlay, a former mayor of the City.  As one of several markets located
  across the city, Findlay Market became a public gathering place and the center
  of the community much as suburban shopping centers do today.  Although the
  Over-the-Rhine neighborhood declined from its original glory and became a
  low-income community in the second half of the Twentieth Century, the
  popularity of the market never declined.  With Over-the-Rhine's current
  resurgence, the market continues to be an important catalyst for new
  development surrounding it.
