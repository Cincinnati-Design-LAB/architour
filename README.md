TODO:

Phase 1:

- [✔️] Introduce map component
- [✔️] Generate static maps with Mapbox
  - [✔️] For buildings
  - [✔️] For tours
- [✔️] Use `srcset` and `sizes` attributes to provide responsive images
  - [✔️] Will need to generate multiple sizes of images
- [✔️] Introduce Link component that:
  - [✔️] Detects external links and adds `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` and an icon
  - [✔️] Provide styling options? -> I want to do the underlining and icon as component variations under `src/components/Link` so that Link is a wrapper around all of them, and the external link is functional, but can optionally wrap itself with an icon. There are some two-ways dependencies here.
- [✔️] Replace icons with consistent kit
- [✔️] Remove icons from tours (or make them optional)
- [✔️] Fix tour building images and cards
- [✔️] Insecure content warning on Netlify. I think this is because of the
- [✔️] Content structure adjustments
  - [✔️] Make attributes more flexible
  - [✔️] `date_of_completion` -> `completion_date`
  - [✔️] Convert existing content
  - [✔️] Put in publishing mechanism (draft mode)
  - [✔️] Should not be able to publish without core attributes
  - [✔️] Figure out what to do with renovation history and make adjustments
    - Put a placeholder in there for now, and going through every building before going live
  - [✔️] When not in edit mode, a tour should not attach draft or invalid buildings
  - [✔️] Show that there are validation errors when in edit mode
- [✔️] Add analytics -> Installed, but need to wait for data collection and then
  can test link tracking
- [✔️] Static map cleanup
  - [✔️] Address overlay on the building map
  - [✔️] Hover state for tour map
  - [✔️] Process static images for all buildings
  - [✔️] Process static images for all tours
  - [✔️] Tour static map should use production mode

Stackbit:

- [✔️] Set up Stackbit
- [✔️] Model with Stackbit
- [ ] Add inline editing for tours and buildings
- [ ] Inline editing for list pages
- [ ] Extend field for page location (use shared definition)
- [ ] Extend field for icon (Tour)
- [ ] Simplify `preview` where it is used (look for `TODO` — talk to Simon)
- [ ] Inherit models with Contentlayer
  - A couple issues holding me back from doing this:
    - https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/438
    - https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/439
- [ ] Move header and footer content into JSON files
  - [ ] With inline editing
- [ ] Model for the home page? I think it'd make the sitemap work a little nicer.
  - [ ] With inline editing
- [✔️] Only the bare minimum required fields
- [ ] Get automatic content reloading working
- [ ] Method for editing/adding images
- [ ] Method for setting the building location without hunting for coordinates
- [ ] Method for generating static map images (not all have them, but it is now tied to published items only)
  - [ ] What to do when static map doesn't exist?
    - Run the static map generator before the build. (Need to also commit to repo, too, without rebuilding.)
    - Show a preview image that mentions it will be automatically populated?

Last Few UI Features:

- [ ] Fix mobile menu -> it looks stupid
- [ ] List and link to tours on the building detail page
- [ ] Building list filtering and pagination
- [ ] Way to get back from PageHeader?

Pre-Launch Cleanup:

- [ ] Link component should be used in building body and attributes
- [ ] Add click tracking
- [ ] Responsive style check

Post-Launch Options:

- [ ] Replace Contentlayer with a custom mechanism
- [ ] Consider putting the image variation complexity in component
  - [ ] Generate dimension ratio transformations (original, square, landscape)
  - [ ] Generate URLs for widths every `100` pixels from `100` to `4000`
  - [ ] ResponsiveImage component should be fed the sizes and automatically add DPR

Notes to add:

- How content is stored and retrieved
- Tools being used
- Working with images
- Validation process
  - What is required
  - What edit mode means
  - Assumptions that we can rely on detail pages to be the primary validator for required production attributes.
